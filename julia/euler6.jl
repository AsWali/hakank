  Euler #6 in Julia.

  Problem 6
  """
  The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
  1^(2) + 2^(2) + ... + 10^(2) = 385

  The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
  (1 + 2 + ... + 10)^(2) = 55^(2) = 3025

  Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten
  natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

  Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one
  hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
