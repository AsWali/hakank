  Euler #32 in Julia.

  Problem 32
  """
  We shall say that an n-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of
  all the digits 1 to n exactly once; for example, the 5-digit number,
  15234, is 1 through 5 pandigital.

  The product 7254 is unusual, as the identity, 39 Ã— 186 = 7254,
  containing multiplicand, multiplier, and product is 1 through 9
  pandigital.

  Find the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product
  identity can be written as a 1 through 9 pandigital.
  HINT: Some products can be obtained in more than one way so be sure
  to only include it once in your sum.
