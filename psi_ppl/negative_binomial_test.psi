  Test of negative binomial.

  From BLOG:
  """  
  NegativeBinomial distribution generates the number of failures until the rth success 
  in a sequence of independent Bernoulli trials each with probability of success p.

  Example: The following code defines a random function symbol x distributed according to a
  Negative Binomial distribution with probability of success p = 0.8 and number of failures r = 2.
  random Integer x ~ NegativeBinomial(2, 0.8);

Bob is a high school basketball player. He is a 70% free throw shooter. That means his probability 
of making a free throw is 0.70. During the season, what is the probability that Bob makes his 
third free throw on his fifth shot?

Solution: This is an example of a negative binomial experiment. The probability of success (P) 
is 0.70, the number of trials (x) is 5, and the number of successes (r) is 3.

To solve this problem, we enter these values into the negative binomial formula.

b*(x; r, P) = x-1Cr-1 * Pr * Qx - r
b*(5; 3, 0.7) = 4C2 * 0.73 * 0.32
b*(5; 3, 0.7) = 6 * 0.343 * 0.09 = 0.18522

Thus, the probability that Bob will make his third successful free throw on his fifth shot is 0.18522.

  From PSI doc:
  negBinomial(r,
      p) samples from the Negative Binomial distribution with the given number of
      failures and success probability.



  For the basketball example above, we check what the probability is that y = 2,
  i.e. that it was in total 5 throws, 3 successful and 2 failures.

  psi --expectation returns a large expression which Mathematica evaluates to
  0.1852

  as the example above.
