/* 

  Euler #32 in JavaScript.

  Problem 32
  """
  We shall say that an n-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of 
  all the digits 1 to n exactly once; for example, the 5-digit number, 
  15234, is 1 through 5 pandigital.

  The product 7254 is unusual, as the identity, 39 Ã— 186 = 7254, 
  containing multiplicand, multiplier, and product is 1 through 9 
  pandigital.

  Find the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product 
  identity can be written as a 1 through 9 pandigital.
  HINT: Some products can be obtained in more than one way so be sure 
  to only include it once in your sum.
